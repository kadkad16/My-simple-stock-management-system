# My-simple-stock-management-system

INSTALLATION GUIDE
1) Import database sql file (inventory.sql) to phpMyAdmin.
2) I did this project using XAMPP application only. Kindly, change the credentials in the file configuration.php if you plan to run it on a hosted site / cPanel. The default credentials are already there.
3) That's all thank you! :)
